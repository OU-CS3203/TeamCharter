# TEAM CHARTER - G5

### First Element - Background
#### Who is the team leader? Who is second?
  Clay Curry is the team leader and Bailey McCarty is the second. 

#### What do key stakeholders need and expect from the team?
We believe each member brings their own thoughts and ideas to the table. The expectations should be that everyone is in this together and no one works on it alone. Our team has been very good with that. The key stakeholders on our team are each of us, as our work exclusively affects us. As we are the primary people effected, we have extremely high expectations for our work. 
We need and expect all members to deliver a quality product in a timely manner. 

#### What does each member bring to the team and their expectations?
Each team member brings unique skills and perspective that is extemely vital when it comes to making requirements as words can be subjective. By having people with different back grounds and life experiences look over our work, we can verify that our requirements are clearly written. I believe we all expect for our team to get an A.

### Second Element - Mission

#### What does success look like?
Success is an "A" in the course and a positive work experience while we are in pursuit of that. Success looks like completing the main task at hand in a timely manner with limited amount of stress. (For this situation at least).
    
#### Spell out the principles:
 Just Do It.

#### Craft a mission statement that is succinct
Serve Rafal the best quality assignments he has ever had while supporting good coding practices according to the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

#### Create interim deadlines
Our goal is to perform at the highest level that we reasonably can and to accomplish our definition of success.  Projects are to be partitioned into smaller completable tasks that are completed in the quickest time possible. This due Wednesday night.

#### Full team check-ins  
Goals set and met for each check-in:
  First Checkin: Before Thanksgiving Break (Get ideas merged together)
  Second Checkin: Maybe during depending on the team's schedule. (How we implement Hatsune Miku on the site and possible sitemap)
