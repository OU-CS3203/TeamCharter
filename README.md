#TEAM CHARTER README FILE

### First Element - Background

    Who is the team leader? Who is second?
    
    Clay Curry is the team leader and Bailey McCarty is the second. 

    What do key stakeholders need and expect from the team?
    
    The key stakeholders on our team are each of us, as our work exclusively affects us. As we are the primary people effected, we have extremely high expectations for our work. 

    What does each member bring to the team and their expectations?
    
    Each team member brings unique skills and perspective that is extemely vital when it comes to making requirements as words can be subjective. By having people with different     back grounds and life experiences look over our work, we can verify that our requirements are clearly written. I believe we all expect for our team to get an A. 


### Second Element - Mission
    What does success look like?
    
    Success is an "A" in the course and a positive work experience while we are in pursuit of that. 

    Spell out the principles:

    Craft a mission statement that is succinct
    
    Our goal is to perform at the highest level that we reasonably can and to accomplish our definition of success.
