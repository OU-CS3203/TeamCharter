#TEAM CHARTER README FILE

### First Element - Background
    Who is the team leader? Second? ...
    ???

    What do key statekholders need and expect from the team?
    Stakeholders need and expect us to deliver a quality product in a timely manner.

    What does each member bring to the team and their expectations?
    We believe each member brings their own thoughts and ideas to the table. The expectations should be that everyone is in this together and no one works on it alone. Our team has been very good with that.


### Second Element - Mission
    What does success look like?
    Success looks like completing the main task at hand in a timely manner with limited amount of stress. (For this situation at least)

    Spell out the principles:
    Just Do It.

    Define the key role
    ummm.

    Craft a mission statement that is succinct
    Our mission is to strive to complete this final project as stressLESS as possible.

    Create interim deadlines
    I don't even know when the deadlines are, but this is due Wednesday night.


### Third element - Roles
    Who is doing what?
    So the project is the Website we looked at previously. How to incorporate Hatsune Miku in the website and use the UI design pattern website???

    Assess all the expertise needed for the team to achieve its goals
    Commitment and perserverance

    Note gaps
    no idea what this is.

    RACI matrix of roles and responsibilities
    no idea how to incorporate this.

    Make sure every member is heard. 
    Got it boss.


### Fourth Element - Budget and Resources
    top-down method - team uses the budget provided for the relevant time period, and decides how to divide it up among projets and tasks.

    bottom up method - team as a group decides what kind of budet and resoures it needs for its operations, and requests it of the larer organization.

    Our approach will more than likely be the top-down method.



### Fifth Element - Internal Checks, Balances, and Reviews
    What is expected of each member and when?
    Get it done.

    Full team check-ins
        Goals set and met for each check-in (possibly 3 Teams checkin with groupme conversations in between)

    Ensure no confusion about performanace and individual assignments.
    This entire assignment is confusing.
